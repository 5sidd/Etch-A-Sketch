This is a simple project involving HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. A grid is created, and when a user's mouse hovers over a cell of the grid, the cell's color changes. The user has an option to change the dimensions of the grid all the way up to a 60 x 60 grid, as well as the option to clear/erase the colors of the current grid.
